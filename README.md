# Mastermind-Game-in-JavaScript
A simple Mastermind game coded as final project for the JavaScript course
I coded this "Mastermind"-style game as a final project for the JavaScript course at the Cimdata Akademie in Berlin.
I had a lot of fun :) I hope you enjoy the code and please feel free to comment and contribute.
